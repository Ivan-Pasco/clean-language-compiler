# Clean Language Compiler Tasks

## Current Critical Issues

After implementing the matrix operations and conducting comprehensive code review, we've identified several critical issues that need to be resolved to ensure the compiler works perfectly:

1. **Parser Issues**:
   - [ ] Fix "Unexpected expression type: integer" syntax error when parsing integer literals in return statements
   - [ ] Implement better file path handling in parser error reporting
   - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors
   - [ ] Test parser with complex nested expressions and edge cases

2. **Module Integration Issues**:
   - [ ] Fix connections between parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator
   - [ ] Ensure proper type propagation between compiler phases
   - [ ] Verify correct handling of all AST node types during compilation
   - [ ] Test full compilation pipeline from source to WebAssembly

3. **Type System Issues**:
   - [ ] Improve type checking for numeric literals
   - [ ] Fix any remaining type conversion issues between parser types and WASM types
   - [ ] Address potential issues with matrix and array types
   - [ ] Ensure consistent type handling between integer and float literals

4. **Memory Management Issues**:
   - [ ] Ensure memory allocator has proper error handling for all edge cases
   - [ ] Verify reference counting works correctly for complex types
   - [ ] Test boundary conditions for array/matrix operations
   - [ ] Implement stress tests for large allocations and complex data structures

5. **Testing & Verification Issues**:
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for full compiler pipeline
   - [ ] Test compilation of various language constructs
   - [ ] Verify generated WebAssembly can be executed correctly
   - [ ] Test all error paths to ensure appropriate error messages

## Progress Summary

In this iteration, we made significant progress on improving the Clean Language compiler:

1. **Matrix Operations**:
   - Successfully implemented matrix multiplication with proper dimension checking and error handling
   - Added matrix determinant calculation for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices
   - Implemented matrix inverse calculation with proper error handling

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Fixed memory allocation and reference counting
   - Implemented proper memory block reuse with free list mechanism
   - Added boundary checking for array and matrix operations
   - Fixed mutable borrow conflicts in the memory manager

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented detailed error reporting for common errors
   - Added function for better type error messages
   - Added memory allocation errors with statistics
   - Added bounds checking errors for arrays and matrices
   - Implemented division by zero detection
   - Added function not found error with suggestions

4. **Compiler Infrastructure**:
   - Fixed non-exhaustive pattern matching issues throughout the codebase
   - Resolved lifetime and borrow checker issues
   - Fixed command line interface option conflicts

However, we still need to address several issues before the compiler can successfully produce working WebAssembly code as outlined in the Critical Issues section above.

## High Priority

- [x] Implement missing Function methods in the stdlib
- [x] Update register_function method in the InstructionGenerator
- [x] Update CodeGenerator to generate proper WebAssembly module sections
- [ ] Fix "Unexpected expression type: integer" syntax error in parser
- [ ] Create end-to-end test cases for verifying compiler functionality
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery in the parser

## Medium Priority

- [x] Fix memory management in the compiler
- [x] Implement the missing matrix_ops functions
  - [x] Matrix multiplication: Implemented with proper dimension checking
  - [x] Matrix determinant: Implemented for matrices up to 3x3
  - [x] Matrix inverse: Implemented for 1x1 and 2x2 matrices
- [x] Add proper error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Enhance type checking for numeric literals
- [ ] Improve memory boundary testing for arrays and matrices
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for all language constructs

## Low Priority

- [ ] Add documentation for the compiler implementation
  - [ ] Document the overall architecture
  - [ ] Document memory management approach
  - [ ] Document error handling system
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test cases 
  - [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end compilation
  - [ ] More extensive matrix operation tests
  - [ ] Error handling verification tests

## Next Steps

1. Fix the parser issue with integer literals in return statements
2. Create targeted tests for each major component
3. Build integration tests to verify the full compilation pipeline
4. Implement remaining test cases
5. Verify memory management with stress tests

The most critical issue to focus on next is fixing the integer literal parsing issue in return statements.
