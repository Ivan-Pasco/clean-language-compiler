# Clean Language Compiler - Current Priority Tasks

## **🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY**

### **PRIORITY 1: Fix WASM Validation Issues** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Generated WASM now passes validation
**Issue**: `function body must end with END opcode` error at offset 0001b63
**Impact**: Previously prevented WASM execution in runtime environments

**Root Cause Identified**:
- ✅ Found the issue in `register_function_with_locals()` method (src/codegen/mod.rs:3947-3953)
- ✅ The method was missing the crucial `func.instruction(&Instruction::End);` call
- ✅ Matrix operations and other stdlib functions using `register_stdlib_function_with_locals` were affected
- ✅ Regular stdlib functions using `register_stdlib_function` were correctly terminated

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Added missing END instruction in `register_function_with_locals()` method at line 3952-3953
- ✅ Now both `register_function()` and `register_function_with_locals()` properly terminate function bodies
- ✅ All standard library functions now generate valid WASM with proper END instructions

**Verification Completed**:
- ✅ All 63 unit tests pass successfully
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite generates valid WASM (12739+ bytes)
- ✅ Simple and comprehensive test commands run without validation errors
- ✅ WASM generation now follows WebAssembly specification requirements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/codegen/mod.rs` - Added END instruction to `register_function_with_locals()` method (line 3952-3953)

## **🔒 SECURITY UPDATES COMPLETED** ✅ 

### **Security Vulnerabilities Resolved**
**Status**: ✅ All critical security issues resolved
**Date**: 2025-07-25

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- ✅ **RUSTSEC-2024-0438**: Wasmtime Windows device filename sandbox bypass - Updated wasmtime 16.0.0 → 24.0.4
- ✅ **RUSTSEC-2025-0046**: Host panic with `fd_renumber` WASIp1 function - Updated wasmtime 16.0.0 → 24.0.4

**Remaining Warnings** (Non-critical):
- ⚠️ **RUSTSEC-2024-0436**: `paste` crate unmaintained (transitive dependency of wasmtime)

**Verification Completed**:
- ✅ `cargo audit` shows no critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ All 63 unit tests pass
- ✅ Simple and comprehensive test suites run successfully 
- ✅ WASM generation continues to work correctly (12739+ bytes generated)
- ✅ No breaking changes in functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `Cargo.toml` - Updated wasmtime version specification from "16.0" to "24.0"
- `Cargo.lock` - All dependencies updated to latest compatible versions

**Dependencies Summary**:
- Total crate dependencies: 255 (updated from previous count)
- Security vulnerabilities: 0 critical
- Warnings: 1 non-critical (unmaintained crate)

## **Development Status Summary**

**✅ Working Components**:
- Core language parsing and compilation
- Standard library function registration (file, math, string operations)
- Type system and semantic analysis
- Code generation infrastructure
- Modern Rust code patterns

**❌ Critical Issue**:
- WASM binary validation prevents runtime execution
- All other functionality depends on resolving this core issue

**Success Criteria**:
- Generated WASM passes `wasm-validate` without errors
- WASM can be executed in runtime environments (Node.js, browsers, etc.)
- All existing functionality continues to work after fix
