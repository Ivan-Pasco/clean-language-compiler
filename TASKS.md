# Clean Language Compiler - Current Priority Tasks

## **üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY**

### **PRIORITY 1: Fix WASM Validation Issues** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Generated WASM now passes validation
**Issue**: `function body must end with END opcode` error at offset 0001b63
**Impact**: Previously prevented WASM execution in runtime environments

**Root Cause Identified**:
- ‚úÖ Found the issue in `register_function_with_locals()` method (src/codegen/mod.rs:3947-3953)
- ‚úÖ The method was missing the crucial `func.instruction(&Instruction::End);` call
- ‚úÖ Matrix operations and other stdlib functions using `register_stdlib_function_with_locals` were affected
- ‚úÖ Regular stdlib functions using `register_stdlib_function` were correctly terminated

**Resolution Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Added missing END instruction in `register_function_with_locals()` method at line 3952-3953
- ‚úÖ Now both `register_function()` and `register_function_with_locals()` properly terminate function bodies
- ‚úÖ All standard library functions now generate valid WASM with proper END instructions

**Verification Completed**:
- ‚úÖ All 63 unit tests pass successfully
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite generates valid WASM (12739+ bytes)
- ‚úÖ Simple and comprehensive test commands run without validation errors
- ‚úÖ WASM generation now follows WebAssembly specification requirements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/codegen/mod.rs` - Added END instruction to `register_function_with_locals()` method (line 3952-3953)

## **üü° COMPLETED TASKS (Archive)**

Recent successfully completed tasks:
- ‚úÖ **File Module Specification Compliance** - Proper lowercase naming (`file.*`)
- ‚úÖ **Standard Library Registration** - All core modules properly registered
- ‚úÖ **Modern Rust Patterns** - Reduced Clippy warnings from 323 to 314

## **Development Status Summary**

**‚úÖ Working Components**:
- Core language parsing and compilation
- Standard library function registration (file, math, string operations)
- Type system and semantic analysis
- Code generation infrastructure
- Modern Rust code patterns

**‚ùå Critical Issue**:
- WASM binary validation prevents runtime execution
- All other functionality depends on resolving this core issue

**Success Criteria**:
- Generated WASM passes `wasm-validate` without errors
- WASM can be executed in runtime environments (Node.js, browsers, etc.)
- All existing functionality continues to work after fix
