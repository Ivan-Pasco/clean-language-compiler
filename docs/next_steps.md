# Next Steps for Clean Language Compiler

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in fixing critical issues in the Clean Language compiler:

1. Fixed parser issues:
   - Resolved "Unexpected expression type: integer" syntax error in return statements
   - Updated AST definitions to be consistent across the codebase

2. Fixed WebAssembly code generation:
   - Implemented proper ordering of WebAssembly sections
   - Fixed export section to correctly export the start function
   - Implemented proper WASM generation for return statements

3. Implemented runtime execution:
   - Added WebAssembly runner using wasmtime
   - Added support for capturing and displaying return values
   - Fixed memory section configuration

4. Created end-to-end testing framework:
   - Added test cases for basic integer return functionality
   - Implemented automated test running with Rust's testing framework
   - Verified proper compilation and execution through both manual and automated testing

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Parser Improvements**:
   - Implement better file path handling in parser error reporting
   - Add error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors
   - Test parser with complex nested expressions and edge cases

2. **Module Integration**:
   - Improve connections between parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator
   - Ensure proper type propagation between compiler phases
   - Implement standard library function availability checks

3. **Code Generation**:
   - Expand WebAssembly code generation to support more language features
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Support complex structures like arrays and string operations

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - Create more comprehensive test cases for various language features
   - Implement proper test result reporting 
   - Add benchmarking for compiler performance

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Documentation**:
   - Document the compiler's architecture and design decisions
   - Create usage documentation for the command-line interface
   - Document the Clean Language specification

2. **Tooling**:
   - Create a language server for IDE integration
   - Implement code formatting tools
   - Add static analysis tools for code quality

3. **Optimizations**:
   - Implement constant folding and other compile-time optimizations
   - Add WebAssembly-specific optimizations
   - Improve compilation speed

## Low Priority Tasks

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Support for classes and inheritance
   - Exception handling
   - Advanced control flow structures

2. **Ecosystem**:
   - Package manager integration
   - Standard library expansion
   - Web platform integration

## Project Development Strategy

The highest priority is to integrate the direct compiler approach with the main codebase. This will ensure all programs compile to valid WebAssembly. Steps to achieve this:

1. Complete parser improvement tasks, focusing on error recovery
2. Fix module integration issues to ensure proper type handling
3. Integrate direct compiler approach into main codegen module
4. Create test cases that verify end-to-end functionality

Once these core improvements are complete, we'll focus on enhancing the runtime system and adding more comprehensive testing capabilities.
