# Testing Plan for Critical Clean Language Compiler Issues

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the 3 critical WASM validation issues that must be resolved immediately, plus testing for the remaining high-priority tasks.

## üî• **CRITICAL ISSUE TESTING (IMMEDIATE)**

### **1. String Interpolation Stack Management Testing**
**Target:** `src/codegen/mod.rs` (line 1350-1370)

**Test Cases Needed:**
- Simple string interpolation: `"Hello ${name}"`
- Multiple interpolations: `"User ${name} is ${age} years old"`
- Nested interpolations with expressions: `"Result: ${calculate(x + y)}"`
- Complex interpolations with method calls: `"Length: ${text.length()}"`

**Validation:**
- Generated WASM must pass wasmtime validation
- Stack must be properly balanced for each interpolation part
- Concatenation operations must have correct operands on stack

### **2. Exception Handling Testing**
**Target:** `src/codegen/instruction_generator.rs` (lines 708, 2402)

**Test Cases Needed:**
- Basic try/catch blocks
- Try/catch/finally combinations
- Nested exception handling
- Exception propagation through function calls

**Validation:**
- Replace `I32Const(0)` placeholders with real exception handling
- WASM must validate without "unknown instruction" errors
- Exception flow control must work correctly

### **3. Memory Operations Testing**
**Target:** `src/codegen/instruction_generator.rs` (lines 2084, 2115)

**Test Cases Needed:**
- Dynamic memory allocation for strings and arrays
- Memory deallocation and cleanup
- Bounds checking for memory operations
- Memory leak prevention

**Validation:**
- Replace placeholder memory operations with real WASM instructions
- Memory allocation must return valid pointers
- Deallocation must properly free memory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY TESTING**

### **4. Parser Error Recovery Testing**
**Test Cases:**
- Syntax errors with recovery and continued parsing
- Missing semicolons, brackets, and other common errors
- Complex nested expression parsing
- File path reporting in error messages

### **5. Async Runtime Integration Testing**
**Test Cases:**
- Future creation and resolution
- Background task execution
- Async/await functionality
- Integration between sync and async runtimes

## üìã **TEST EXECUTION PRIORITY**

### **Phase 1: Critical WASM Validation (URGENT)**
1. Create test files for each critical issue
2. Verify current failures with `cargo build` and `wasmtime validate`
3. Test fixes incrementally as they're implemented
4. Ensure all WASM validation errors are resolved

### **Phase 2: Functional Testing**
1. End-to-end testing of fixed features
2. Integration testing between compiler phases
3. Performance testing of generated WASM

### **Phase 3: Regression Testing**
1. Verify all previously working features still function
2. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
3. Comprehensive test suite execution

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Critical Issues Resolved When:**
1. ‚úÖ String interpolation generates valid WASM without stack errors
2. ‚úÖ Exception handling compiles to real WASM instructions (not placeholders)
3. ‚úÖ Memory operations use real allocation/deallocation (not placeholders)
4. ‚úÖ All test programs compile and execute successfully
5. ‚úÖ `wasmtime validate` passes for all generated WASM files

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Automated test suite for critical issues
- WASM validation integration in CI/CD
- Performance benchmarks for generated code
- Regression test coverage for all major features

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create test cases for the 3 critical WASM validation issues
2. Implement fixes for string interpolation stack management
3. Replace exception handling placeholders with real implementations
4. Implement real memory allocation/deallocation operations
5. Verify all fixes with comprehensive testing

**Timeline:** These critical issues should be resolved within the next development cycle to restore basic compiler functionality.
