# Testing Plan for Clean Language Compiler

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the remaining high-priority tasks in the Clean Language compiler. We now have a working end-to-end test framework that verifies basic compilation and execution of Clean Language programs.

## Completed Tests
- ✓ Basic end-to-end compilation and execution testing
- ✓ Return value verification from compiled WebAssembly

## High Priority Test Areas

### Parser Testing
1. **Error Recovery Tests**
   - Test that the parser can recover from syntax errors and continue parsing
   - Verify error messages include correct file path and line number information
   - Test complex nested expressions to ensure robust parsing

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test unusual but valid syntax combinations
   - Verify handling of Unicode characters in identifiers and strings
   - Test maximum nesting levels for expressions and blocks

### Module Integration Testing
1. **Type Propagation Tests**
   - Verify that types are correctly propagated between compiler phases
   - Test type checking for complex expressions and functions
   - Verify semantic analysis catches type mismatches

2. **Error Message Tests**
   - Test that error messages are helpful and include context
   - Verify line numbers and source locations in error messages

### Code Generation Testing
1. **WASM Validation Tests**
   - Verify that generated WASM is always valid
   - Test memory management in the generated code
   - Verify correct handling of different numeric types

2. **Optimization Tests**
   - Compare optimized vs unoptimized code
   - Check that optimizations don't change program behavior

## Medium Priority Tests

### Benchmark Tests
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure compilation time for various program sizes
   - Benchmark execution speed of generated WASM

### Complex Feature Tests
1. **Language Feature Tests**
   - Test more complex language constructs like classes and inheritance
   - Verify array and matrix operations
   - Test string manipulation

## Testing Tools

Our testing infrastructure now includes:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Cargo's test framework for component testing

2. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Automated test that compiles and executes Clean Language programs
   - Verifies the expected return values from execution

3. **Planned: Fuzzing Tests**
   - Generate random but valid Clean Language programs
   - Verify that the compiler handles them correctly

## Test Execution Strategy

Tests should be run:
1. Before submitting any changes
2. As part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. With both debug and release builds

## Success Criteria

The testing will be considered successful when:
1. All tests pass consistently
2. Edge cases are handled correctly
3. The compiler provides helpful error messages
4. Generated WASM is always valid and executes correctly
