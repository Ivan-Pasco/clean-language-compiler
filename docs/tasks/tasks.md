# Clean Language Compiler Tasks

This document outlines the remaining tasks for the Clean Language compiler project, organized by priority.

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Parser Improvements**:
   - Implement better file path handling in parser error reporting
   - Add error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors
   - Test parser with complex nested expressions and edge cases
   - Implement proper error recovery in the parser

2. **Module Integration**:
   - Fix connections between parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator
   - Ensure proper type propagation between compiler phases
   - Implement standard library function availability checks during semantic analysis
   - Add more comprehensive error messages for type mismatches

3. **Code Generation**:
   - Integrate the direct_compiler approach into the main codegen module
   - Fix memory management in WebAssembly output
   - Implement proper error handling in generated WebAssembly

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Code Generation**:
   - Add debugging symbols to generated WebAssembly code
   - Enhance type checking for numeric literals
   - Improve memory boundary testing for arrays and matrices

2. **Runtime System**:
   - Add runtime error handling and reporting
   - Implement proper memory management in the runtime system
   - Add standard library function implementations

3. **Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive test suite for all language constructs
   - Implement integration tests with real-world examples
   - Add performance benchmarks for generated code
   - Compare generated WebAssembly with hand-written versions

## Low Priority Tasks

1. **Documentation**:
   - Document the overall architecture
   - Document memory management approach
   - Document error handling system

2. **Testing**:
   - More extensive matrix operation tests
   - Error handling verification tests

## Next Steps

The highest priority is to fix the parser issues and improve error handling. Now that we have a working end-to-end test framework, we should focus on expanding the language features supported by the compiler and improving the robustness of the compiler components.
