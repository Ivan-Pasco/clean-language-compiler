# Clean Language Compiler Tasks

This document outlines the remaining tasks for the Clean Language compiler project, organized by priority.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Parser Improvements** âœ… COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Implemented better file path handling in parser error reporting
   - âœ… Added error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors
   - âœ… Enhanced error messages with help text and location information
   - âœ… Implemented proper line/column calculation from byte offsets
   - âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage for parser edge cases
   - âœ… Created ErrorRecoveringParser for collecting multiple errors

2. **Module Integration** âœ… COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Fixed connections between parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator
   - âœ… Ensured proper type propagation between compiler phases
   - âœ… Fixed critical bug in variable lookup (find_local method)
   - âœ… Added comprehensive integration tests covering all compilation phases
   - âœ… Verified end-to-end compilation from source to WASM binary

3. **Code Generation** âœ… COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Streamlined CodeGenerator struct and removed unused fields
   - âœ… Improved generate() method to return WASM binary directly
   - âœ… Added debugging information and source location tracking
   - âœ… Fixed WASM binary generation (now producing 136-159 bytes vs previous 0 bytes)
   - âœ… Enhanced error messages with better context and suggestions
   - âœ… Verified all integration tests pass with proper WASM output

4. **Standard Library Integration** âœ… COMPLETED:
   - âœ… Integrated built-in functions (print, printl, math operations)
   - âœ… Added string manipulation functions (len)
   - âœ… Implemented array operations (array_length, array_get)
   - âœ… Added math functions (abs) with proper WASM implementations
   - âœ… Ensured proper memory management for complex data types
   - âœ… Added comprehensive stdlib tests (all passing)
   - âœ… Generated significantly larger WASM binaries (300+ bytes vs 136 bytes)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority Tasks

5. **Error Handling & Recovery** ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PRIORITY:
   - Implement try-catch blocks in the language
   - Add proper error propagation through the compilation pipeline
   - Enhance error messages with suggestions and fix hints
   - Add warning system for potential issues

## ðŸ”„ Medium Priority Tasks

6. **Type System Enhancements**:
   - Implement generic types and type parameters
   - Add union types and optional types
   - Improve type inference capabilities
   - Add compile-time type checking for complex expressions

7. **Memory Management**:
   - Implement garbage collection for dynamic allocations
   - Add reference counting for memory safety
   - Optimize memory layout for better performance
   - Add memory debugging tools

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

8. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement dead code elimination
   - Add constant folding and expression simplification
   - Optimize WASM output size and execution speed
   - Add compilation caching

9. **Language Features**:
   - Add class inheritance and polymorphism
   - Implement modules and namespaces
   - Add async/await functionality
   - Support for external library imports

10. **Developer Experience**:
    - Create language server protocol (LSP) support
    - Add syntax highlighting definitions
    - Implement code formatting tools
    - Add comprehensive documentation generator

## ðŸ“Š Progress Summary

- **Completed**: 4/10 major tasks (40%)
- **Current Focus**: Error Handling & Recovery
- **Next Milestone**: Complete error handling and type system enhancements
- **Overall Status**: âœ… Core compilation pipeline working end-to-end with stdlib support
