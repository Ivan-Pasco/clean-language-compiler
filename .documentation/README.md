## Quick Reference

### Common Development Tasks

| Task | Primary Documentation | Key Files |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| Add new syntax | [Parser](./parser.md) + [Development Guide](./development-guide.md) | `grammar.pest`, parser modules |
| Fix type errors | [Semantic Analysis](./semantic-analysis.md) | `src/semantic/` modules |
| Add stdlib function | [Standard Library](./standard-library.md) | `src/stdlib/` modules |
| Debug WASM output | [WebAssembly](./webassembly.md) | `src/codegen/` modules |
| Optimize performance | [Development Guide](./development-guide.md) | All modules |

### Debugging Quick Start

```bash
# Parse and show AST
cargo run --bin clean-language-compiler debug -i file.cln --show-ast

# Compile with detailed output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin clean-language-compiler compile -i file.cln -o output.wasm

# Examine generated WebAssembly
cargo run --bin wasm2wat output.wasm > output.wat
```

### Testing Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test category
cargo test --test integration_tests
cargo test --test parser_tests

# Run with detailed output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Key Components:**
- **Parser**: Converts source code to AST using Pest grammar
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Validates types, scopes, and language semantics
- **Code Generator**: Produces WebAssembly bytecode with memory management
- **Standard Library**: Provides built-in functions and runtime support
- **Runtime**: Handles async operations, I/O, and host integration

## Development Principles

When working on this project, always keep these principles in mind:

1. **Type Safety First** - Clean Language prioritizes compile-time safety
2. **WebAssembly Native** - All features must compile efficiently to WASM
3. **Developer Experience** - Provide excellent error messages and debugging
4. **Memory Safety** - Use reference counting and bounds checking
5. **Specification Compliance** - Follow the language specification exactly

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues or need clarification:

1. **Check the relevant documentation** in this directory
2. **Review the Language Specification** for authoritative language rules
3. **Examine existing code patterns** in the codebase
4. **Look at test cases** for usage examples
5. **Check TASKS.md** for known issues and priorities

## Contributing

When making changes:

1. **Read the Development Guide** for workflows and best practices
2. **Follow existing code patterns** and architectural decisions
3. **Add comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
4. **Update documentation** when changing behavior
5. **Maintain WebAssembly compatibility** for all language features

## Documentation Maintenance

This documentation is designed to be:
- **Accurate**: Reflects the current state of the codebase
- **Complete**: Covers all major systems and components
- **Practical**: Focuses on actionable information for development
- **Up-to-date**: Maintained alongside code changes

If you find inaccuracies or need additional information, the documentation should be updated to reflect the current project state.
